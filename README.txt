Requirements: Python 3.0.1 or later

As a high school student bored with studying SAT word lists, I created this game in order to make the process of 
learning and memorizing words much more interesting.

Rules:

Plays exactly the same as normal hangman meaning that you:
	1. Are presented with a bunch of blanks &
	2. Guess a letter
	3. If the letter is in the word, the list of underscores is updated to show the letters location in the word
	4. If the letter is not in the word, a hangman created with dashes, asterisks, and slashes
	5. Once the entire hangman is "drawn" you lose

In order to make this as educational as possible, the user may add words to the pre-written list of SAT words.

Good luck and have fun!
